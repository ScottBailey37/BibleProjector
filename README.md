# BibleProjector

This project came out of necessity. In searching for software that my church could use to display Bible verses on the overhead screen during Bible study, I tried many different applications. However, they were all overloaded with features that really cluttered the user interface and made it difficult to just quickly and simply display verses. Additionally, they were resource hungry and extremely slow on a simple laptop. So, when I had some free time I created this application to fill the need that our church had. It is still a work in progress and I plan on implementing several other features as I get time.

Additionally, though it is written in VB.NET, I plan on rewriting it in C#, which has become a much more popular language than VB.NET. If you have suggestions hit me up.
